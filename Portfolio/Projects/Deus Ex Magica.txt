Deus Ex Magica was a character I made for a Tournament that was set in my TTRPG Duo Dungeons. Most of his features come from the idea that I wanted to create the ultimate wizard. And while he did reach the finals, he unfortunately did not win. This was made at a time when my primary art software was Adobe Illustrator and is the pinnacle of my Vector art done at the time. It took me around 3 days. His garbs were designed to look like wizard robes, with the classic hat and holding an orb over classic wands or staves. He is an elf, so I gave him pointy ears, and because of how the game works, he is part ghost, so I did a cool opacity effect to make him partially transparent like he is fading from reality.
