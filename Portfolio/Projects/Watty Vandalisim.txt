    This was a project for my CTK 201 Intro to Creative Technologies Class. The project goal was to go out in the world and make some legal Vandalism, like chalk graffiti, putting googly eyes on sink faucets, etc. I was not very comfortable with this, going outside, not vandalism. So, instead, I took a picture of Watterson Towers Dormitory on my way back to my dorm room. The idea was to recreate the classic King Kong image with Watterson instead of the Empire State Building. The total process took around 6-7 hours. I wanted to go for a black-and-white look, so I did it completely tonally, starting with a black blob that made King Kong's iconic figure. Then, I went through and added highlights of white and grey, blending between them to create fur shading and various features. Once King Kong was done, I added a black-and-white filter to the original image and cropped it.
