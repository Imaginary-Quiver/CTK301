    This was a project for my CTK 201 Intro to Creative Technologies Class. The project goal was to take another artist's work, digital, anolauge, audio, you name it, and reimagine it in some way. The one caviate was that no games were allowed, which was a bummer as that is my major. So, I did the next best thing and took two of the most recognizable bosses from the videogame Terraria, and redrew them in my Vector art style with Adobe Illustrator. The total proccess took around 4-6 hours and was very straight forward. I spent around 1-2 hours on "The Eye of Cthulhu", 2-3 on "Skeletron", and 1 on the background. It was definately a fun project, though it did test the patience of my instructor.
