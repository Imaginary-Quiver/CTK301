The Pitch

    The first idea that led to the creation of Hex-okles was, "What if I made chess but on a hex grid?" It began with me learning how to make a hex grid work in Godot, my game engine of choice. As Godot 4 had just been released, there were very few resources on how to use it, aside from official documentation. Eventually, I got a basic system working and made some simple pieces with different movement options. Eventually, I added a faction selection menu, which turned the project on its head.

Three Factions

    After the knight faction was added, which I later named the Rookien Kingdom, I set about adding a second faction with vastly different playstyle and tricky move sets. That was the Earth Monastery, which was built upon a small number of powerful pieces. Compared to the swarm tactics of the Rookien Kingdom, The Earth Monastery plays hard and fast with very a single strong ranged unit. It opened my mind to the possibilities, all until the project became corrupted.

Rebuilding

    After the game files were corrupted, likely due to a Godot 4 update, I was understandably upset. It took 3 weeks before this point to make the game, and I lost most of it in the blink of an eye. All hope was not lost, however, because all the art assets were still intact. So, mustering my energy, I deleted all the corrupted files and re-coded the entire game in just a day. Not only was it completed faster, but I was able to learn from my prior mistakes and improve the code immensely. After which, I spent the rest of the week adding a new faction, The Flame Bringer Cult. This being my third faction, I still had a lot of ideas. They became a hyper-aggressive and powerful Area of Effect (AoE) faction. Without the ability to run away, most of their pieces require careful thought before moving. At this point, I had been working on this game non-stop for a month and was feeling burnt out. So, I implemented a main menu, gathered some free sound effects, and called it done. Maybe I'll eventually return to this project when I'm more experienced, but for now, I find the Work Acceptable.
