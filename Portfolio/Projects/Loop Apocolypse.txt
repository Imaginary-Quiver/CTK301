Loop Apocolypse was the final project for my CTK 240 Audio Design Class. The goal was to create an understandable Narrative that was 2-3 minutes long and did not contain any music or human voice in the foreground. Upon learning the requirement, I immediately thought of Groundhog Day and knew I was going to make a time loop.

The Process

When I began working on the project, I started with a basic storyboard in a text document. I had planned for 10 loops, though only 3 made it into the final product. After that, I opened up Adobe Audition and found the sound effects I would use. I got around 30 different effects from various free sound websites and YouTube videos marked with the correct copyright. Then, I loaded them all into Audition and began arranging, editing, and layering them. I would create a loop, starting with 1 or 2 effects at once. Then the next loop, I copied over the sounds and changed the ending to continue the loop. By the 3rd loop it was built in such a way, that each loop got more complex the longer they went on, with the 3rd loop having 16 different tracks of sounds. I was planning to add more, but at this point, my computer was struggling to keep Audition from crashing, so I had to stick with that number of sounds. After listening to it a few more times and tweaking different aspects till it clicked, I exported it and submitted, what I believe is my best Audio work yet.
