This art portrays a generic member of a dangerous cult in my long-running Dungeons and Dragons campaign. A lot of the design went into following the rule of a cult that prevents individualism. Alongside that, I had a heavy focus on making them creepy and following the lore. As all the cultists are warlocks, in my world, that means all of them have full-body tattoos. So, a cult of them would cover most of their skin to stay discrete. Additionally, I wanted to forgo the typical cult colors of black or dark reds and instead went with a white and gold aesthetic with bright red accents. This is reminiscent of more heinous groups in the real world, but I thought it was fitting for a group that would kill millions on a dime. Their gold mask was designed to be memorable with a manic grin, and attached mane of silver hair. Overall, the artwork only took about 1-2 hours as it was meant to be concept art rather than a finished piece.
