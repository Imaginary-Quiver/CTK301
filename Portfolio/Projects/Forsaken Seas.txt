A Simple Start
.txts
Forsaken Seas was my Narrative Game Project and Final Printed Project for my CTK 351 Game Design 1 class. I was greatly inspired by Pirates of The Carribean while making this and really wanted to make a ship combat game. So the idea for Forsaken Seas was born. Over the next week I contructed a rudementary prototype to test mechanichs and get some basic rules. After testing the combat with my teacher, it received high praise for a prototype, and I got good feedback on what to change. After that I wrote the rules for the main portion of the game concerning story encounters and winning.

After the prototype was tested and the rules were ready, it was time to cross an ocean, methaphorically speaking at least. This was the hardes part of the process as I had to go through and make hundreds of art assets for the game. With 6 different decks for cards and many different tokens to design, I had my work cut out for me. That was also no including the many ships and cargo I needed to make for the game's tetris style inventory system. It took me 2 weeks and an all nighter, but I got it done in time. I really have to thank Olivia Gouge, my Girlfriend, for helping with all the art for the over 25 different crewmates. Without her, I would have never finished this project on time, or with the level of deatail it holds.

A Bitter Sweet End

After Submitting the game for my Narrative Game project, and working on a party game in the mean time, I knew I wanted to perfect it for my final project where it would be profesionally printed. At that point I had 2 weeks to perfect my game and convert all the art assets into one apropriate for printing. It took that time and another all-nighter, but I did manage it. It was a struggle to organize, but I bet it was memorable when the instructors received a game that had 303 files a part of it, and a extremely detailed component list. So memorable in fact, that later we received news that all the game printing had to be delayed by a month, all because some people with coppyright issues, and a "unnamed" game that was so insanely complex that it went way over budget. Yeah, that unnamed game was probably mine, as my peers pointed out. Then, after waiting 3 month, I finnaly recieved the printed version of Forsaken Seas, and... it was heart breaking. Don't get me wrong, it turned out pretty good, Everyone praised the box art and design, but I knew the unfortunat truth. The game was unplayable, either to budgetcuts or a mistake on the instructor's/or manufactor's part, it was missing key components, alot of them were not the quality I desperately asked for, and two of them were completely wrong. I later found out that one of my files was corrupted and caused to final product to be lacking most of the words it needed to be usable. I am not saying it is the fault of anyone, but myself, however seing a game you poured your heart and soul into, not well handled, is depressing. I still apreciate the opportunity I was given to have the game printed, and the work other did to make it possible for me. Maybe, when I am less upset by it, I will take the time to fix the game I was given, so that it is at least playable, or even do a Kickstarter to try and get it published, either way it was an amazing experience that I would love to do again.
