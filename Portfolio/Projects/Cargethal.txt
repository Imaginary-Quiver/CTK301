A Failed Alchemist
.txts
Cargethal is a Dungeons and Dragons character I played in a friend's campaign. His whole character arc is about a failed alchemist who is struggling with substance abuse. When designing him I wanted to make a very flawed character who could change for the better over the story he was played in. So I made him callous, materialistic, and have a clinical detachment from almost everything around him. His substance abuse comes from the need to drown out his failure and lack of understanding when it comes to basic human emotions.

The Design Process

When designing his character I took a lot of inspiration from Arcane's Silco. His color palette was decided fairly early on in the design process as I knew I wanted it to be primarily putrid greens with a hint of pinkish-purple. On the actual design of his appearance, I made him emaciated to drive how the substance abuse and gave him various scaring to show past alchemical experiments. His glasses were designed in a bid to recreate that 60s or 80s hippie look with the colored glasses. I made them broken and cracked to hint at his continuous emotional state and to highlight his right eye which was scarred in a particularly notable accident. All in all, it only took around 3-4 hours to complete the simple bust of Cargethal, but I do plan to draw a revised full-character version in the future.
