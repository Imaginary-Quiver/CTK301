The Demigod of Struggle

Media/Art_Project_Images/Zavel.png
This art portrays a Zavel, the Rinara Demigod of Struggle, from my long-running Dungeons and Dragons campaign. As a character, he is meant to be a neutral party that could antagonize one moment and help the next. He and his species, the Rinara, are alien to my DnD world of Kard, coming from the realm of Trinotra. He was formerly the Saint of the Cult of the Origin, which the Grinning order is a long-removed branch of, but was disgraced when he sapped power from their figure of Worship, the Origin. After being sealed for thousands of years, he was let loose from his tomb by a group of treasure hunters and now wanders the cosmos, seeking new opportunities to ascend to full godhood.

His Design
.txts
A lot of his design is an inherent side effect of being a Rinara, but that doesn't mean he is not unique. Especially since he is the last of his kind. The image depicts Zavel as he is, right after being unsealed. His general figure was built to give off the appearance of someone who has lived most of their life in a constant bid for survival. I began with his head, as that influenced most of his form, with the additional pair of eyes, horns, and long hair making him stand out. Additionally, I decided that his dull pastel blue skin was a perfect in-between for the grey and dark blue I was originally envisioning to go along with his white and pinkish hair. The tattoos that covered his body were a later addition after all the line art and coloring were done. The tattoos represent his Domain of Struggle compared to the Domain of the Origin, being that of Games. Overall, the work took around 8 hours in total, and his appearance made a great impression on my players who unsealed him.
